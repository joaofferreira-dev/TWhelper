# TWhelper
Leightwheight tool I built to help guild officers to to coordinate territory wars in SWGOH.
Developed for **private use** , locally deployed and customized for real guild planning. Designed to streamline team assignments and strategic planning during competitive events. Used for 6 months until replaced by a third party commercial tool.
Initially planned to interface with discord, feature not pursued by officer preference. 

**Status : Archived** 
Secrets, access tokens, datasets and media files were **purged**. This repo is for **code review only**, not intended to run as-is.

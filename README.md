# TWhelper
Leightwheight tool I built to help guild officers coordinate territory wars in SWGOH.
Developed for **private use** , locally deployed and customized for real guild planning. Designed to streamline team assignments and strategic planning during competitive events. Used for 6 months until replaced by a third party commercial tool.
Initially planned to interface with discord, feature not pursued by officer preference. 

**Status : Archived** 

Secrets, access tokens, datasets and media files were **purged**. This repo is for **code review only**, not intended to run as-is.

App uses Django and rest framework for assynchonous tasks(update database).

**Tech stack**: Python, Django, REST framework, bootstrap.

Adequate recovery behaviours for update not implemented.
